There are three classic and widely adopted data science methodologies:

- Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)
- Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD)
- Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess (SEMMA).

They use data mining methods,are best suited for structured data and are useful for using descriptive and predictive analytics. They share some common activities, such as data gathering, data transformation, data modeling, and model evaluation


## CRISP-DM
- Its a proven way to guide datamining efforts. Any industry can use this to help structure a data science project.

Consists of 6 phases:
1) Business Understanding
2) Data Understanding
3) Data Preparation
4) Modelling
5) Evaluation
6) Deployment

Sequence of steps aint strict but it is ITERATIVE, i.e. some phases can be repeated to improve the result.


## KDD 
- Full form : Knowledge Discovery in Database
- KDD represents the overall process of collecting data and methodically refining it.
- Typically has 5 steps:
  1) Selection
  2) Preprocessing
  3) Transformation
  4) Data Mining
  5) Interpretation / Evaluation
 
- KDD is iterative, meaning new data can be integrated and transformed to get different and more appropriate results


 ## SEMMA
 - Stands for Sample Explore Modify Model ASSESS
 - SEMMA can help solve a range of business problems, such as fraud identification, customer retention and turnover, database marketing, customer loyalty, market segmentation, and risk analysis.
- SEMMA is also an iterative process, in which answering one set of questions often leads to more interesting and more specific questions.

Dichotomous data, meaning each cell has only two possible values
